# Predicting Real Estate Using Classical Statistics

## Foreword
The notebook contained herein details my work to develop a multiple linear regression model to predict real estate prices in King County, WA. The dataset is publicly available in Kaggle, and was originally downloaded from the King County Open Data website.

This kernel differs from those already published in that it leverages an extensive EDA process in order to engineer features and preprocess data to optimize it for MLR. Doing so allowed me to achieve an $r^2$ value of 0.987, which is in the top 1% of publicly available kernels. The validation data confirms that this model is not overfit.

This kernel sits alongside a fictitious stakeholder presentation to demonstrate how I would report these findings in a business setting. There is also a non-technical presentation which I use to explain my process to they layperson. I also published a short writeup [in medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/write-less-explore-more-7dd39980ed2a) detailing my exploratory data analysis approach.
